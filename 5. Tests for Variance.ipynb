    "## Testing the Equality of Variances with F-Test\n",
    "Let $X_1, \\ldots, X_n$ and $Y_1, \\ldots, Y_m$ be independent and identically distributed samples from two populations, each with a normal distribution. The expected values for the two populations can be different, and the hypothesis to be tested is that the variances are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions:**\n",
    "- The data in each group or dataset should be a simple random sample from a larger population.\n",
    "- The populations from which the samples are drawn should be approximately normally distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Formulation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let  \n",
    "$$\\overline{X} = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i$$\n",
    "$$\\overline{Y} = \\frac{1}{m} \\sum_{i=1}^{m}Y_i$$  \n",
    "be the sample means.\n",
    "\n",
    "And \n",
    "$$s_X^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_i - \\overline{X})^2$$\n",
    "$$s_Y^2 = \\frac{1}{m-1} \\sum_{i=1}^{m}(Y_i - \\overline{Y})^2$$ \n",
    "be the sample variances.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the test statistic is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F = \\frac{s_X^2}{s_Y^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The F-test is a common method to compare variances. The test statistic (F-statistic) is calculated as the ratio of variances between groups to variances within groups. The formula for the F-statistic is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $ s_X^2 $ is the sample variance of the first group.\n",
    "- $ s_Y^2 $ is the sample variance of the second group.\n",
    "\n",
    "The F-statistic follows an F-distribution with n-1 and m-1 degrees of freedom. The hypothesis for the F-test is stated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):** The variances are equal across all groups or datasets.\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$):** The variances are not equal across all groups or datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Rule:**\n",
    "If the p-value associated with the F-statistic is less than the chosen significance level (commonly 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis, indicating evidence of unequal variances.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The F-test is sensitive to departures from normality, and in some cases, alternative tests like Levene's test or Bartlett's test may be considered.\n",

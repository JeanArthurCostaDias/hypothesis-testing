    "## Chi-Squared Goodness-of-Fit Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The chi-squared goodness-of-fit test is a statistical test used to assess whether the observed frequency distribution of categorical data matches the expected distribution. It is a non-parametric test that is particularly useful when dealing with categorical variables or counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Categorical Data:** The data should be categorical, meaning observations fall into distinct categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Independent Observations:** Each observation should be independent of others.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Expected Frequencies:** The expected frequencies for each category should be reasonably large (typically, each expected frequency should be greater than 5).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Formulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The test involves comparing the observed frequencies ($O_i$) with the expected frequencies ($E_i$). The chi-squared statistic ($\\chi^2$) is calculated using the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the sum is taken over all categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Degrees of Freedom:\n",
    "\n",
    "The degrees of freedom ($df$) for the chi-squared test depend on the number of categories ($k$) and are given by $df = k - 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision Rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "The obtained $\\chi^2$ value is compared against the critical $\\chi^2$ value at a chosen significance level to determine whether to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):** The observed and expected frequencies are consistent; there is no significant difference between the observed and expected distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$):** There is a significant difference between the observed and expected distributions.\n"
